## Motivation
Is the movie industry dying? is Netflix the new entertainment king? Those were the first questions that led to create a dataset focused on movie revenue and analyze it over the last decades. But, why stop there? There are more factors that intervene in this kind of thing, like actors, genres, user ratings and more.

--------------------------------

## Questions
I provide recommendations about the type of movies a film production company would have to do if the box takings have to be maximized. As an example, I provide answers to the following questions that the company could have:

* In which genre should the film company focus on?

* How important is to produce a good film (high IMDB rating)to get lots of takings?

* Is it better to produce a film for a general audience or is it better to produce a film targeted to a particular segment?

* Does Higher Budget translate to more Revenue for Animation Movies?

* Is there an actor/actress that guarantees the success of the film? Or a director?
